#Label To Placeholder

Adds placeholder attributes to inputs, using the text value of the associated Label element.

Scenario:
You are using a CMS or other system which controls the form markup. It creates nice label elements, but not placeholder attributes. This script will plug those label values into placeholder attributes. Tada!
